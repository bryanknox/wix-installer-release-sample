# WiX MSI Installer for Sample WPF App

This directory contains a WiX 6 installer project that creates an MSI installer for the Sample WPF Application. The installer project is fully parameterized to support different build scenarios.

This WiX installer project can be easily adapted to other .NET applications that need an MSI for installation on Windows machines.

## Overview

The WiX installer project uses the WiX 6 Toolset.

- **File Harvesting**: Uses the `Files` element to automatically harvest all files from the published application output
- **Parameterization**: Supports configurable product name, manufacturer, version, file paths, and MSI filename

## Project Structure

- `Package.wxs` - Main package definition with parameterized properties
- `AppComponents.wxs` - Component group that harvests files using the `Files` element
- `Folders.wxs` - Directory structure definition
- `Package.en-us.wxl` - Localization strings
- `WixMsi.wixproj` - MSBuild project file with parameterization support

## Key Features

The WiX 6 installer implements the following key features:

- **Per-User Installation**: Installs to the user's local application data folder, no admin privileges required
- **Selectable Install Location**: Users can choose the installation directory via WixUI_InstallDir dialog
- **End User License Agreement (EULA)**: Displays license agreement during installation
- **Automatic File Harvesting**: Uses WiX 6 `Files` element to include all published application files
- **Start Menu Shortcuts**: Creates application shortcuts in the user's Start Menu
- **Major Version Upgrades**: Automatic upgrade/replacement of previous versions
- **Downgrade Protection**: Prevents installation of older versions over newer ones
- **Parameterized Build**: Configurable product name, version, manufacturer, and file paths
- **Localization Support**: Supports multiple languages (currently en-US included)
- **Embedded Installation Files**: All files embedded in MSI for single-file distribution

### Per-User Installation

The installer is configured with `Scope="perUser"` which provides several benefits:

- **No Administrator Rights Required**: Users can install the application without elevated privileges
- **User-Specific Installation**: Each user gets their own copy of the application
- **Clean Uninstall**: Complete removal without affecting other users or system files
- **Installation Location**: Files are installed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\{ProductName}` by default

### Selectable Install Location

The installer uses the WiX 6 `WixUI_InstallDir` dialog set to provide users with the ability to choose their installation directory:

- **Default Location**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\{ProductName}` (user's local application data folder)
- **Custom Location**: Users can browse and select any accessible directory
- **Directory Creation**: Installer automatically creates the selected directory if it doesn't exist
- **Path Validation**: Ensures the selected path is valid and accessible

### End User License Agreement (EULA)

The installer includes a license agreement step in the installation wizard:

- **RTF Format**: License is displayed from the `eula.rtf` file included in the project
- **Required Acceptance**: Users must accept the license terms before proceeding with installation
- **Customizable**: Replace `eula.rtf` with your own license agreement
- **Localization**: License text can be localized for different languages

### Automatic File Harvesting

The installer uses the WiX 6 `Files` element to automatically harvest all files from the published application directory:

- **Dynamic File Discovery**: Automatically includes all files from the `PublishedFilesPath` without manual enumeration
- **Recursive Directory Support**: Includes files from subdirectories using the `**` wildcard pattern
- **No Manual Maintenance**: New files are automatically included when the application is updated
- **Preserves Directory Structure**: Maintains the original folder structure in the installation

See [Files Element Documentation](https://docs.firegiant.com/wix/schema/wxs/files/) in the WiX Core docs.

### Start Menu Shortcuts

The installer creates Start Menu shortcuts for easy application access:

- **Program Menu Integration**: Creates shortcuts in the user's Programs folder
- **Product-Specific Folder**: Shortcuts are organized under a folder named after the product
- **Clean Uninstall**: Shortcuts and folders are automatically removed during uninstallation
- **Working Directory**: Shortcuts are configured with the correct working directory

### Major Version Upgrades

The installer is configured with WiX 6's modern upgrade strategy using the `UpgradeStrategy="majorUpgrade"` attribute. This ensures:

- **Automatic Upgrades**: When a newer version is installed, it automatically replaces the previous version
- **Single Entry in Add/Remove Programs**: Only one version appears in Windows "Installed Apps" list
- **Preserved Settings**: User settings and configurations are maintained during upgrades
- **Downgrade Protection**: Installing an older version over a newer one is blocked by default

**How it works:**
- The `PackageId` remains constant across all versions (acts as the upgrade family identifier)
- The `PackageVersion` changes with each release
- The `ProductCode` is automatically generated uniquely for each build
- Windows Installer uses the PackageId to detect and upgrade related products

**Version Numbering:**
- Use strict 3-part version numbers (e.g., "1.2.3")
  - The installer expects a strict 3-part `PackageVersion` version number (e.g., "1.2.3").
    Otherwise, Windows Installer will ignore any fourth field (e.g. 1.2.3.4)
    and may not detect upgrades correctly.
- Increment the version number for each release to enable proper upgrade detection

### Parameterized Build System

The installer project is fully parameterized to support different build scenarios and easy customization:

- **Product Information**: Configurable product name, manufacturer, and version
- **File Paths**: Customizable paths for published files and main executable
- **MSI Output**: Configurable MSI filename and output location
- **Build Integration**: Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and build scripts
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults provided for all parameters

### Localization Support

The installer is designed to support multiple languages and regions:

- **String Resources**: All user-visible text is externalized to `.wxl` localization files
- **Current Support**: US English (en-US) localization included
- **Extensible Design**: Additional languages can be added by creating new `.wxl` files
- **Culture-Specific Builds**: Can build MSI packages for specific cultures and regions

### Embedded Installation Files

The installer is configured for single-file distribution:

- **Embedded CAB**: All installation files are embedded directly in the MSI using `EmbedCab="true"`
- **No External Dependencies**: MSI contains everything needed for installation
- **Simplified Distribution**: Single MSI file can be distributed without additional files
- **Reduced File Count**: Eliminates the need for separate CAB files or external media

## Parameterization

The installer project supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `PackageId` | Unique identifier for the package | "bryanknox.SampleWpfApp.5fce338" |
| `PackageVersion` | 3-part version number (e.g., "1.2.3") | "1.0.0" |
| `ProductName` | Display name of the product | "Sample WPF App" |
| `Manufacturer` | Company/manufacturer name | "Bryan Knox" |
| `PublishedFilesPath` | Path to published application files | "../local-published/SampleWpfApp-output" |
| `MainExecutableFileName` | Name of the main executable file in the PublishedFilesPath | "SampleWpfApp.exe" |
| `MsiFileName` | Base name for the generated MSI file (without .msi extension) | "WixMsi" |

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Install WiX 6 Toolset
   - `dotnet tool install --global wix --version 6.0.0`
1. Ensure the application has been published to the directory specified by the `PublishedFilesPath` parameter.

### Building the MSI Installer

#### Option 1: Using a PowerShell Build Script (Recommended)

Use the provided PowerShell scripts for an automated build process:

```powershell
# Build & publish app then build MSI
.\scripts\PublishAndBuildMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3"

# Build & publish app then build MSI, with custom product information
.\scripts\PublishAndBuildMsi.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -ProductName "My WPF App" -Manufacturer "My Company"

# Build & publish app then build MSI with custom MSI filename
.\scripts\PublishAndBuildMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3" -MsiFileName "MyApp-Setup"

# Build & publish app then build MSI, placing output in c:\build\msi\
.\scripts\PublishAndBuildMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3" -MsiOutFolderPath "c:\build\msi"

# Build only the MSI (if app is already published)
.\scripts\BuildWixMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3"

# Build only MSI with custom filename
.\scripts\BuildWixMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3" -MsiFileName "MyApp-Setup"

# Build only MSI, placing output in .\artifacts\msi\
.\scripts\BuildWixMsi.ps1 -Version "1.2.3" -MsiOutFolderPath ".\artifacts\msi"
```

#### Option 2: Using dotnet build directly

```powershell
dotnet build WixMsi\WixMsi.wixproj `
  --configuration Release `
  -p:Platform=x64 `
  -p:ProductName="Sample WPF App" `
  -p:Manufacturer="Bryan Knox" `
  -p:PackageVersion="1.2.3" `
  -p:PublishedFilesPath="C:\full\path\to\published\files" `
  -p:MsiFileName="MyApp-Setup"
```

#### Option 3: Using MSBuild

```powershell
msbuild WixMsi\WixMsi.wixproj `
  /p:Configuration=Release `
  /p:Platform=x64 `
  /p:ProductName="Sample WPF App" `
  /p:Manufacturer="Bryan Knox" `
  /p:PackageVersion="1.2.3" `
  /p:PublishedFilesPath="C:\full\path\to\published\files" `
  /p:MsiFileName="MyApp-Setup"
```

### Output Location

The MSI installer will be created in:
```
WixMsi\bin\{Platform}\{Configuration}\en-US\{MsiFileName}.msi
```

For example:
- Default: `WixMsi\bin\x64\Release\en-US\WixMsi.msi`
- With custom name: `WixMsi\bin\x64\Release\en-US\MyApp-Setup.msi`

## GitHub Actions Integration

The parameterized design makes it easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

Example GitHub Actions usage:

```yaml
- name: Build MSI Installer
  run: |
    dotnet build WixMsi/WixMsi.wixproj `
      --configuration Release `
      -p:Platform=x64 `
      -p:ProductName="Sample WPF App" `
      -p:Manufacturer="Bryan Knox" `
      -p:PackageVersion="${{ github.event.inputs.version }}" `
      -p:PublishedFilesPath="${{ github.workspace }}/published-output" `
      -p:MsiFileName="SampleWpfApp-${{ github.event.inputs.version }}-Setup"
```

## Development Notes

### Version Handling

- The installer expects a strict 3-part `PackageVersion` version number (e.g., "1.2.3").

- Version is used for MSI package versioning and upgrade logic

### MSI File Naming

- The `MsiFileName` parameter controls the output MSI filename
- Do not include the `.msi` extension - it will be added automatically
- Useful for including version numbers or build identifiers in the filename

### Localization

- Currently supports US English (en-US) localization
- Localization strings are defined in `Package.en-us.wxl`
- Additional languages can be added by creating additional `.wxl` files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Published files not found"**
   - Ensure the application has been published first using `PublishLocalSampleWpfApp.ps1`
   - Verify the `PublishedFilesPath` parameter points to the correct location

2. **"WiX toolset not found"**
   - Install WiX 6 Toolset: `dotnet tool install --global wix --version 6.0.0`
   - Ensure WiX is available in your PATH

3. **"Bind path not resolved"**
   - Check that the `PublishedFilesPath` is an absolute path
   - Verify that the path contains the published application files

4. **"Multiple versions appearing in Add/Remove Programs"**
   - Ensure all installers use the same `PackageId` value
   - Verify that `UpgradeStrategy="majorUpgrade"` is set in Package.wxs
   - Check that version numbers are incrementing properly (newer versions should have higher numbers)

5. **"Upgrade not working"**
   - Verify that `PackageVersion` is strictly 3-parts (`1.2.3`).
   - Verify the `PackageVersion` is equal to or higher than the currently installed version.
   - Ensure the `PackageId` matches between versions
   - Check Windows Event Viewer for MSI installation logs if needed

### Debugging

To enable verbose output during build:

```powershell
dotnet build WixMsi\WixMsi.wixproj --verbosity detailed
```
