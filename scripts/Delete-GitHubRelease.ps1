.SYNOPSIS
    Deletes a GitHub release and its associated tag from both remote and
    local repositories.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs a complete cleanup of a GitHub release by:
    1. Detecting the GitHub repository from local git remote (if -Repo not
       specified)
    2. Deleting the release from GitHub using the GitHub CLI
    3. Deleting the remote tag from the origin repository
    4. Deleting the local tag from the local repository

    This script requires the GitHub CLI (gh) to be installed and
    authenticated, and requires git to be available in the PATH.

.PARAMETER Repo
    The GitHub repository in the format 'username/repo-name' or
    'organization/repo-name'. This must be the full repository identifier as
    used by GitHub. If not specified, the repository will be automatically
    detected from the local git remote 'origin'.

.PARAMETER TagName
    The name of the tag/release to delete. Should include the version prefix
    if used (e.g., 'v1.0.0', '1.2.3-beta', etc.).

.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-GitHubRelease.ps1 -Repo "bryanknox/wpf-release-play" `
                               -TagName "v1.0.0"

    Deletes the v1.0.0 release and tag from the bryanknox/wpf-release-play
    repository.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-GitHubRelease.ps1 -TagName "v1.0.0"

    Deletes the v1.0.0 release and tag from the repository detected from the
    local git remote 'origin'.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-GitHubRelease.ps1 -Repo "myorg/myproject" `
                               -TagName "2.1.0-preview"

    Deletes the 2.1.0-preview release and tag from the myorg/myproject
    repository.

.NOTES
    Prerequisites:
    - GitHub CLI (gh) must be installed and authenticated
    - Git must be available in PATH
    - User must have appropriate permissions to delete releases and push to
      the repository
    - For auto-detection of repository, must be run from within a git
      repository with an 'origin' remote

    This script will fail if:
    - Auto-detection is used but no 'origin' remote is found or the remote
      URL is not a GitHub repository
    - The user doesn't have permission to delete the releas

   This script will attempt to delete each of the following, and output
   warnings for any failures:
    - release in the GitHub repo
    - remote tag
    - local tag
