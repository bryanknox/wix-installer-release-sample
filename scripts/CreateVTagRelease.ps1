.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new vTag (version tag) in the GitHub repo, which will trigger
    a GitHub Actions workflow to publish a new release of the app and its MSI installer.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script creates an annotated git tag with a specified version number,
    pushes it to the origin repository,
    and then verifies the tag was created successfully by fetching and displaying
    the tag information from the remote.

    The script enforces strict 3-part semantic versioning (e.g., "1.2.3")
    and automatically prefixes the tag with "v".

    Pushing a vTag to the GitHub repo triggers a GitHub Actions workflow
    that will build and publish a new release of the app and its MSI installer.

.PARAMETER Version
    The version number for the release tag.
    Must be in strict 3-part format (major.minor.patch) using only digits.
    Examples: "1.0.0", "2.15.3", "10.234.5678"

    The script will automatically prefix this with "v" to create the tag name
    (e.g., "1.2.3" becomes "v1.2.3").

.EXAMPLE
    .\CreateVTagRelease.ps1 -Version "1.2.3"
    Creates and pushes tag "v1.2.3" with message "Release version 1.2.3"

.EXAMPLE
    .\CreateVTagRelease.ps1 "2.0.1"
    Creates and pushes tag "v2.0.1" with message "Release version 2.0.1"

.NOTES
    Requires: Git to be installed and available in PATH
    Requires: Current directory to be a git repository
    Requires: Remote origin to be configured
